                        Machine learning is a hot topic almost in every domain right now, including software
                        engineering. More and more research papers are being published, introducing new approaches and
                        improving existing ones, solving dozens of different tasks in this domain. Many of these papers
                        report very high quality of their models, so sometimes reading them leaves you wondering, why
                        don't we see features like this in our development tools? Well, in most cases, it is not that
                        straightforward. In this talk, I discuss the way research ideas and academic prototypes find
                        their way into software products at JetBrains. I will show several cases of how machine learning
                        approaches are integrated into a modern IDE used by millions of developers every day. I will
                        also highlight the challenges we usually face while doing it and discuss the promising research
                        areas in this field.

                        Timofey Bryksin is a head of research lab at JetBrains, a company devoted to creating tools
                        for software engineers (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, YouTrack, TeamCity, Space, and many others).
                        Before that he spent almost a decade working in industry as software engineer and engineering
                        manager. He is also an Associate Professor at Saint Petersburg State University and Higher
                        School of Economics University in Saint Petersburg, Russia. His research interests revolve
                        around software engineering tools and processes and how they can be enhanced with various types
                        of data collected in this field. He holds a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from Saint Petersburg
                        State University.

                    <p class="text-justify">Software that requires maintenance and evolution presumably has value that
                        causes the producers of the software—individuals and organizations—to invest in these
                        activities. Given that there is almost always more that any given software package or product
                        can provide, software producers should be motivated in enabling maintenance and evolution
                        activities and should be interested in the software engineering research efforts that are
                        undertaken to address identified pain points. Yet, despite efforts by providers of research
                        results (software engineering researchers) and interest by recipients (software producing
                        individuals and organizations), a gap remains and too few research results make their way into
                        use. In this talk, I will focus on research results that take the form of software tools for
                        software producers and explore what this gap is and how the gap might be bridged. This
                        exploration will aim to provide some practical tips for how to orient research to create usable
                        and useful software tools.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify"><b>Short bio: </b>
                        Gail C. Murphy is a Professor of Computer Science and Vice-President Research and Innovation at
                        the University of British Columbia. She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and a Fellow
                        of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), as well as co-founder of Tasktop Technologies
                        Incorporated.
                        After completing her B.Sc. at the University of Alberta in 1987, she worked for five years as a
                        software engineer in the Lower Mainland. She later pursued graduate studies in computer science
                        at the University of Washington, earning first a M.Sc. (1994) and then a Ph.D. (1996) before
                        joining UBC.
                        Dr. Murphy’s research focuses on improving the productivity of software developers and knowledge
                        workers by providing the necessary tools to identify, manage and coordinate the information that
                        matters most for their work. She also maintains an active research group with post-doctoral and
                        graduate students.
