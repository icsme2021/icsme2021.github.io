          <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME) is the
            premier forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends,
            experiences, and challenges in software maintenance and evolution. We invite high quality submissions

          </ul>

          <p class="text-justify">ICSME welcomes innovative ideas that are timely, well presented, and evaluated. All
            submissions must position themselves within the existing literature, describe the relevance of the results
            to specific software engineering goals, and include a clear motivation and presentation of the work.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">To establish a consistent set of expectations in the review process, the authors are
            asked, as part of the online submission process, to identify their papers with one or more of the following
            categories:</p>

          <h3>Technological</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">A paper in which the main contribution is of a technical nature. This includes novel
            tools, new algorithms, new theories, modeling languages, infrastructures, processes, methods and other
            technologies. Such a contribution does not necessarily need to be evaluated with humans. However, clear
            arguments, backed up by evidence as appropriate (whether through a proof, complexity analysis, or run-time
            analysis, among others), must show how and why the technology is beneficial, why a new method is needed,
            whether it is in automating or supporting some user task, refining our modeling capabilities, improving some
            key system property, etc.</p>

          <h3>Empirical</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">A paper in which the main contribution is the empirical study of a software evolution
            technology or phenomenon. This includes controlled experiments, case studies, and surveys of professionals
            reporting qualitative or quantitative data and analysis results. The authors should provide convincing
            arguments, with commensurate experiences, why certain methods or models are needed. Such a contribution will
            be judged on its study design, appropriateness and correctness of its analysis, and threats to validity.
            Replications are welcome.</p>

          <h3>Perspectives</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">A paper in which the main contribution is a novel perspective on the field as a whole,
            or part thereof. This includes assessments of the current state of the art and achievements, systematic
            literature reviews, framing of an important problem, forward-looking thought pieces, connections to other
            disciplines, and historical perspectives. Such a contribution must, in a highly convincing manner, clearly
            articulate the vision, novelty, and potential impact.

          <p class="text-justify">All papers should be full papers, and papers may belong to more than one category.</p>

          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">All submissions that meet the submission criteria (see below) and fit the scope of the
            conference will be reviewed by three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the
            basis of soundness, importance of contribution, originality, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison
            to related work, and convincing evaluation of the proposed approach. Submissions that are not in compliance
            with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without
            being reviewed. Submitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures. Papers submitted to
            ICSME 2021 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review
            elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME 2021. Submitting the same paper to different tracks of ICSME
            2021 is also not allowed.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">The best papers of ICSME 2021 will be awarded IEEE TCSE Distinguished Paper awards.
          </p>

          <h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted for
            inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. All authors of all accepted papers will be asked to complete
            an electronic IEEE Copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera-ready
            versions. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper
            at the conference. Failure of at least one author to register by the early registration date will result in
            the paper being withdrawn from the conference proceedings. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from
            distribution after the conference (e.g., by not placing it in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library) if the paper
            is not presented at the conference. Presentation details will follow notifications of acceptance.</p>

          <h3>How to Submit</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Similar to recent years, we are following a double-blind reviewing process. Submitted
            papers must adhere to the following rules:

          <p class="text-justify">Author names and affiliations must be omitted. (The track co-chairs will check
            compliance before reviewing begins.)
            References to authors' own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not "We build on our
            previous work..." but rather "We build on the work of...")
            Please see the Double-Blind Reviewing FAQ (<a href="https://icsme2020.github.io/faq_double_blind.html"
              target="_blank">https://icsme2020.github.io/faq_double_blind.html</a>) for more information and guidance.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format.
            Please use the templates available <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html"
              target="_blank">here</a>. LaTeX users should use the following configuration:
            \documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}. Microsoft Word users should use the US Letter format template. Papers
            must not exceed 10 pages (including figures and appendices) plus up to 2 pages that contain ONLY references.
            All submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted online by the deadline via the <a
              href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsme2021" target="_blank">ICSME 2021 EasyChair
              conference management system</a>. Any relevant supplemental material should also be anonymized and
            submitted by
            the same deadline through EasyChair. All authors, reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE
            Code of Conduct (<a
              href="https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/ieee_code_of_conduct.pdf"
              target="_blank">https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/ieee_code_of_conduct.pdf</a>).
          <p class="text-justify">Authors of selected papers from the research track will be invited to submit extended
            versions of their work to a special issue of the Springer International Journal of Empirical Software
            Engineering (EMSE). These selected papers will be expected to comply with the standard guidelines when
            publishing an extended version of a paper, including the addition of about 30% new material.</p>
          </p>

          <h3>Open Science Policy</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">ICSME encourages open science practices. Sharing data sets, replication packages, or
            preprints are not required, but we provide guidance for those wishing to do so.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">If you decide to share data or scripts, we encourage you to use an online archival
            site such as zenodo.org, figshare.com, or archive.org. These sites ensure the content is archived and
            generate a DOI for the content, enabling it to be cited. To learn more about how to share data while
            maintaining double-blind, read the explanation provided by Daniel Graziotin available here <a
              href="https://ineed.coffee/5205/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance/"
              target="_blank">https://ineed.coffee/5205/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance/</a>.
          </p>

          <p class="text-justify">We recognise that anonymising artifacts such as source code is more difficult than
            preserving anonymity in a paper. We ask authors to take a best effort approach to not reveal their
            identities. We will also ask reviewers to avoid trying to identify authors by looking at commit histories
            and other such information that is not easily anonymised. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may
            want to look into using <a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/"
              target="_blank">https://anonymous.4open.science/</a> which is an open source tool that helps you to
            quickly Double-blind your repository.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">ICSME supports and encourages Green Open Access also called self-archiving. We
            encourage authors to self-archive a preprint of your accepted manuscript in an e-print server such as
            arXiv.org. Open access increases the availability of your work and increases citation impact (<a
              href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013636"
              target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0013636</a>). To learn
            more about open access, please read the Green Open Access FAQ (<a
              href="https://avandeursen.com/2016/11/06/green-open-access-faq/"
              target="_blank">https://avandeursen.com/2016/11/06/green-open-access-faq/</a>) by Arie van Deursen. Note
            that if your research includes scraped GitHub data, the GitHub Terms of Service require that “publications
            resulting from that research are open access” (<a
              href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/"
              target="_blank">https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/</a>). If possible, we recommend
            that you archive your paper (e.g., on arXiv or on your website) only after the ICSME reviewing process is
            completed, to avoid undermining the double-blind reviewing process in place.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">Authors of papers accepted into ICSME 2021 are invited to submit their artefacts to
            the joint Artifact Evaluation Track for ICSME, VISSOFT, and SCAM. Papers with accepted artefacts will be
            awarded badges and invited to present lightning talks at the ROSE (Recognising and Rewarding Open Science in
            Software Engineering) Festival Track. Please see the Call for Participation for the Artifact Evaluation
            Track.</p>
