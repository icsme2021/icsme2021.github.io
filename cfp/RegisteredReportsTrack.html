              <p class="text-justify">Following the successful experience of 2020, Empirical Software Engineering
                journal
                (EMSE), in
                conjunction with the International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME), is
                continuing the RR track. The RR track of ICSME 2021 has two goals: (1) to
                prevent  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HARKing" target="_blank">HARKing</a> (hypothesizing
                after
                the results are known) for empirical studies; (2) to provide early
                feedback to authors on their initial study design. For papers submitted to the RR track, methods and
                proposed analyses are reviewed prior to execution. Pre-registered studies follow a two-step process:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Stage 1: A report is submitted that describes the planned study. The submitted report is evaluated
                  by
                  the reviewers of the RR track of ICSME 2021. Authors of accepted pre-registered studies will be given
                  the
                  opportunity to present their work at ICSME.</li>
                <li>Stage 2: Once a report has passed Phase 1, the study will be conducted and actual data collection
                  and
                  analysis take place. The results may also be negative! The full paper is submitted for review to EMSE.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-justify">See the associated Author's Guide. Please contact the ICSME track chairs – Maria
                Teresa Baldassarre or Christoph Treude - for any questions, clarifications, or comments.</p>

              <h3>Paper Types, Evaluation Criteria, and Acceptance Types</h3>
              <p class="text-justify">The RR track of ICSME 2021 supports two types of papers:</p>
              <p class="text-justify"><b>Confirmatory:</b> The researcher has a fixed hypothesis (or several fixed
                hypotheses) and
                the objective of the study is to find out whether the hypothesis is supported by the facts/data.</p>
              <p class="text-justify">An example of a completed confirmatory study:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Inozemtseva, L., & Holmes, R. (2014, May). Coverage is not strongly correlated with test suite
                  effectiveness. In Proceedings of the 36th international conference on software engineering (pp.
                  435-445).
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-justify"><b>Exploratory:</b> The researcher does not have a hypothesis (or has one that may
                change
                during the study). Often, the objective of such a study is to understand what is observed and answer
                questions such as WHY, HOW, WHAT, WHO, or WHEN. We include in this category registrations for which the
                researcher has an initial proposed solution for an automated approach (e.g., a new deep-learning-based
                defect prediction approach) that serves as a starting point for his/her exploration to reach an
                effective
                solution.
              </p>
              <p>Examples of completed exploratory studies:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Gousios, G., Pinzger, M., & Deursen, A. V. (2014, May). An exploratory study of the pull-based
                  software
                  development model. In Proceedings of the 36th International Conference on Software Engineering (pp.
                  345-355).</li>
                <li>Rodrigues, I. M., Aloise, D., Fernandes, E. R., & Dagenais, M. (2020, June). A Soft Alignment Model
                  for
                  Bug Deduplication. In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories
                  (pp. 43-53).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The reviewers will evaluate RR track submissions based on the following criteria:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The importance of the research question(s).</li>
                <li>The logic, rationale, and plausibility of the proposed hypotheses.</li>
                <li>The soundness and feasibility of the methodology and analysis pipeline (including statistical power
                  analysis where appropriate).</li>
                <li>(For confirmatory study) Whether the clarity and degree of methodological detail is sufficient to
                  exactly
                  replicate the proposed experimental procedures and analysis pipeline.</li>
                <li>(For confirmatory study) Whether the authors have pre-specified sufficient outcome-neutral tests for
                  ensuring that the results obtained can test the stated hypotheses, including positive controls and
                  quality
                  checks.</li>
                <li>(For exploratory study, if applicable) The description of the data set that is the base for
                  exploration.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>The outcome of the RR report review is one of the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>In-Principal Acceptance (IPA):</b> The reviewers agree that the study is relevant, the outcome of
                  the
                  study
                  (whether confirmation / rejection of hypothesis) is of interest to the community, the protocol for
                  data
                  collection is sound, and that the analysis methods are adequate. The authors can engage in the actual
                  study for Stage 2. If the protocol is adhered to (or deviations are thoroughly justified), the study
                  is
                  published. Of course, this being a journal submission, a revision of the submitted manuscript may be
                  necessary. Reviewers will especially evaluate how precisely the protocol of the accepted
                  pre-registered
                  report is followed, or whether deviations are justified.</li>
                <li><b>Continuity Acceptance (CA):</b> The reviewers agree that the study is relevant, that the
                  (initial)
                  methods
                  appear to be appropriate. However, for exploratory studies, implementation details and post-experiment
                  analyses or discussion (e.g., why the proposed automated approach does not work) may require follow-up
                  checks. We’ll try our best to get the original reviewers. All PC members will be invited on the
                  condition
                  that they agree to review papers in both, Stage 1 and Stage 2. Four (4) PC members will review the
                  Stage 1
                  submission, and three (3) will review the Stage 2 submission.</li>
                <li><b>Rejection:</b> The reviewers do not agree on the relevance of the study or are not convinced that
                  the
                  study
                  design is sufficiently mature. Comments are provided to the authors to improve the study design before
                  starting it.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-justify"><b>Note:</b> For ICSME 2021, we will only offer IPA to confirmatory studies.
                Exploratory
                studies in software engineering often cannot be adequately assessed until after the study has been
                completed
                and the findings are elaborated and discussed in a full paper. For example, consider a study in an RR
                proposing defect prediction using a new deep learning architecture. This work falls under the
                exploratory
                category. It is difficult to offer IPA, as we do not know whether it is any better than a traditional
                approach based on e.g., decision trees. Negative results are welcome; however, it is important that the
                negative results paper goes beyond presenting “we tried and failed”, but rather provides interesting
                insights to readers, e.g., why the results are negative or what that means for further studies on this
                topic
                (following criteria of REplication and Negative Results (RENE) tracks, e.g.,

              <p class="text-justify">NB: Please contact the ICSME RR track chairs with any questions, feedback, or
                requests for clarification.
                Specific analysis approaches mentioned below are intended as examples, not mandatory components.</p>
              <h5>I. Title (required)</h5>
              <p class="text-justify">Provide the working title of your study. It may be the same title that you submit
                for publication of your
                final manuscript, but it is not mandatory<br />
                Example: Should your family travel with you on the enterprise? Subtitle (optional): Effect of
                accompanying
                families on the work habits of crew members</p>
              <h5>II. Authors (required)</h5>
              <p class="text-justify">At this stage, we believe that a single blind review is most productive
              <h5>III. Structured Abstract (required)</h5>
              <p class="text-justify">The abstract should describe the following in 200 words or so:
              <ul>
                <li><b>Background/Context</b><br />
                  What is your research about? Why are you doing this research, why is it interesting?
                  Example: “The enterprise is the flag ship of the federation, and it allows families to travel onboard.
                  However, there are no studies that evaluate how this affects the crew members.”</li>
                <li><b>Objective/Aim</b><br />
                  What exactly are you studying/investigating/evaluating? What are the objects of the study? We welcome
                  both
                  <b>confirmatory</b> and <b>exploratory</b> types of studies.<br />
                  Example (Confirmatory): We evaluate whether the frequency of sick days, the work effectiveness and
                  efficiency differ between science officers who bring their family with them, compared to science
                  officers
                  who are serving without their family.<br />
                  Example (Exploratory): We investigate the problem of frequent Holodeck use on interpersonal
                  relationships
                  with an ethnographic study using participant observation, in order to derive specific hypotheses about
                  Holodeck usage.</li>
                <li><b>Method</b><br /> How are you addressing your objective? What data sources are you using?<br />
                  Example: We conduct an observational study and use a between subject design. To analyze the data, we
                  use a
                  t-test or Wilcoxon test, depending on the underlying distribution. Our data comes from computer
                  monitoring
                  of Enterprise crew members.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <h5>IV. Introduction</h5>
              <p class="text-justify">Give more details on the bigger picture of your study and how it contributes to
                this bigger picture. An
                important component of phase 1 review is assessing the importance and relevance of the study questions,
                so
                be sure to explain this.</p>
              <h5>V. Hypotheses (required for confirmatory study) or research questions</h5>
              <p class="text-justify">Clearly state the research hypotheses that you want to test with your study, and a
                rationalization for the
                hypotheses.<br />
                Hypothesis: Science officers with their family on board have more sick days than science officers
                without
                their family.<br />
                Rationale: Since toddlers are often sick, we can expect that crew members with their family onboard need
                to take sick days more often.</p>
              <h5>VI. Variables (required for confirmatory study)</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Independent Variable(s) and their operationalization</li>
                <li>Dependent Variable(s) and their operationalization (e.g., time to solve a specified task)</li>
                <li>Confounding Variable(s) and how their effect will be controlled (e.g., species type (Vulcan, Human,
                  Tribble) might be a confounding factor; we control for it by separating our sample additionally into
                  Human/Non-Human and using an ANOVA (normal distribution) or Friedman (non-normal distribution) to
                  distill
                  its effect).</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-justify">For each variable, you should give: - name (e.g., presence of family) -
                abbreviation (if you intend to
                use
                one) - description (whether the family of the crew members travels on board) - scale type (nominal:
                either
                the family is present or not) - operationalization (crew members without family on board vs. crew
                members
                with family onboard)</p>
              <h5>VII. Participants/Subjects/Datasets (required)</h5>
              <p class="text-justify">Describe how and why you select the sample. When you conduct a meta-analysis,
                describe the primary studies
                / work on which you base your meta-analysis.<br /><br />
                <b>Example:</b> We recruit crew members from the science department on a voluntary basis. They are our
                targeted
                population.</p>
              <h5>VIII. Execution Plan (required)</h5>
              <p class="text-justify">Describe the experimental setting and procedure. This includes the methods/tools
                that you plan to use (be
                specific on whether you developed it (and how) or whether it is already defined), and the concrete
                steps
                that you plan to take to support/reject the hypotheses or answer the research questions.<br /><br />
                <b>Example:</b> Each crew member needs to sign the informed consent and agreement to process their data
                according
                to GDPR. Then, we conduct the interviews. Afterwards, participants need to complete the simulated
                task...<br /><br />
