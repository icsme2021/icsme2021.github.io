          <hr class="featurette-divider">
          <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">The overall goal of the ICSME 2021 doctoral symposium is to help the next generation
            of ICSME researchers form
            connections and gain advice on their proposed areas of research. To support this goal, the doctoral
            symposium
            welcomes submissions in three tracks: early predoctoral (pre-proposal), late predoctoral (post-proposal),
            and
            post-doctoral. The three tracks will meet together for the day to enable multi-level peer mentoring as more
            senior
            students and junior researchers reflect on their experiences during their PhD studies.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Pre-proposal (Early Pre-doctoral) Track</b>
              <p class="text-justify">This track is open to all students who are or are considering pursuing a doctoral
                degree in the general area of
                software maintenance and evolution but have not yet completed the dissertation proposal phase (or
                equivalent) of
                their program. Students should have already participated in at least one independent study/research
                project as part
                of their research group. This track aims to expose early career students to the ICSME research community
                and
                research process and to help them progress toward their dissertation proposal.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Post-proposal (Late Pre-doctoral) Track</b>
              <p class="text-justify">This track is open to PhD students currently pursuing a doctoral degree in the
                general area of software maintenance
                and evolution, who have completed the dissertation proposal phase (or equivalent) of their program. This
                track aims
                to bring together students who (a) are pursuing a specific research question, (b) have a concrete
                research plan for
                completing their studies, and (c) have obtained some initial results motivating their methodology and
                plan. Students
                will gain feedback from a broader community outside their institution and network with peers in the
                ICSME research
                community.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Post-doctoral Track</b>
              <p class="text-justify">This track is open to researchers who have recently (in the past year) completed
                their PhD dissertation in the
                general area of software maintenance and evolution. This track provides an opportunity for participants
                to present
                their research agenda to a general audience and gain feedback in preparation for job interviews.
                Participants will
                develop a research vision that builds on their dissertation and learn to present it to a general
                audience who is
                familiar with the research area, but not their specific project or focus.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            All submissions that meet the submission criteria (see below) and fit the scope of the conference will be
            evaluated
            by the doctoral symposium chairs on the basis of their relevance to the ICSME community, their originality,
            and
            their technical soundness. Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or
            that are
            out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without being reviewed. Submitted papers must comply
            with IEEE
            plagiarism policy and procedures.</p>

          <h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Accepted post-proposal and post-doctoral papers will be published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
            Accepted
            pre-proposal papers will be made available to the attendees of the symposium, but will not be published in
            the
            IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Please review
            the ICSME 2021 Publication Requirements for more details. Participants from all tracks will present at the
            symposium. Presentations will be limited in time to leave sufficient time for discussion and feedback. Each
            participant will also prepare and present a poster during the symposium. During the main conference, the
            author will
            present the poster again at a public poster session, having the opportunity to receive feedback from the
            larger
            audience. More presentation details will follow after notification of acceptance.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Each student author of an accepted paper will have the opportunity to
            discuss their work one-on-one with a member of the Doctoral Symposium PC
            or other members of the ICSME research community.</p>

          <h3>How to Submit</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Submissions must be formatted according to the ICSME 2021 Formatting Instructions. Papers should provide all
            details
            (name, affiliation, contact details) of the PhD student, who should be the first author of the paper. For
            early and
            late pre-doctoral, supervisors should also be authors of the paper. Pre-proposal papers must not exceed 2
            pages (including figures and
            appendices) plus up to 1 page that contains ONLY references. Post-proposal
            and post-doctoral papers must not exceed 4 pages (including figures and
            appendices) plus up to 1 page that contains ONLY references. All submissions must be in PDF and
            must be
            submitted online by the deadline via the ICSME 2021 Doctoral Symposium EasyChair conference management
            system at <b>TBD</b>.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Pre-proposal (Early Pre-doctoral) Track</b>
              <p class="text-justify">For the Pre-proposal (Early Pre-doctoral) Track, the submission should include a
                description of a research project
                in which the student has already participated. Focus on research questions and on lessons learned so far
                about the
                research and the research process. Expound on your own proposal ideas. What is your general research
                area? What open
                questions/problems do you find personally meaningful, and why are they interesting to you? It is
                acceptable for this
                to be a broad outline of the research area and where you think you might want to contribute. To
                encourage students
                to share their nascent ideas, accepted papers will not be published in the conference proceedings.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Post-proposal (Late Pre-doctoral) Track</b>
              <p class="text-justify">For the Post-proposal (Late Pre-doctoral) Track, the submission should include a
                statement of the general technical problem addressed, its importance, and the specific research
                questions under investigation. Provide an overview of the related research background in the context of
                the work being conducted, a sketch of the research methodology, the envisioned contributions, a
                description of the evaluation method, and the results
                obtained so far.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Post-doctoral Track</b>
              <p class="text-justify">For the Post-doctoral Track, the submission should be a shortened version of a
                research proposal/statement for a job application and include a synopsis of the PhD dissertation,
                focusing on the research problem addressed, its contributions, evidence documenting these contributions
                (in terms of working software systems or case studies), and a statement of their innovation and
                importance, a description of your research vision going forward for the next few years - not just the
                next few obvious steps after the dissertation: Think about what your next PhD topic would be. Think big
                picture! - and two or three "lessons learned” through the PhD process. Reflect on what worked well and
                what could have gone better. The first of the submission's references should be the author's
                dissertation, including a URL where it is accessible.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-justify">For any questions, please contact the program chairs.</p>
