          <p class="text-justify">
            The ROSE Festival (<b>R</b>ecognizing and Rewarding <b>O</b>pen Science in <b>SE</b>), a special track
            within ICSME, is a venue
            where researchers can receive public credit for facilitating and participating in open science in Software
            Engineering. For ICSME 2021, the ROSE Festival will (a) host lightning talks about the accepted artifacts,
            and (b) present peer-reviewed short position papers about open science in Software Engineering research.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">
            <b>Artifact Evaluation Track (ICSME, SCAM, VISSOFT)</b>. Authors of <b>papers accepted to ICSME, SCAM, and
              VISSOFT
              2021</b> are invited to submit artifacts associated with those papers to the ICSME Artifact Evaluation
            Track for
            evaluation as candidate <b>available, reusable, reproduced, or replicated artifacts</b>. Papers with
            artifacts that
            meet our review criteria will be awarded badges, noting their contributions to open science in Software
            Engineering. If an artifact is accepted, authors will be invited to give a lightning talk on the artifact at
            the ROSE Festival Track held during ICSME 2021, and we will work with IEEE to add badges to the electronic
            versions of the authors' paper(s), corresponding to the Available and Reusable categories. For more
            information, see the call for submissions below.

            pages + two pages for references) about trends and issues of importance regarding open science in software
            engineering research, particularly with regard to the set of topics within the scope of the ICSME community.
            We will consider a broad range of position papers that includes analyses and retrospectives on how the
            community has embraced or rejected open science principles. Particular topics of interest include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Best practices for reproduction and replication studies</li>
            <li>Best practices for artifact preparation and evaluation</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">
            These papers should fall within the scope of topics covered by ICSME, VISSOFT, and SCAM, and be related (in
            a broad sense) to one or more of those topics:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Change and defect management</li>
            <li>Code cloning and provenance</li>

          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">
            While many open science principles and challenges are universal within the broad software engineering
            community, the papers published in this track should be targeted towards the ICSME/VISSOFT/SCAM community.
            At minimum, concrete examples should target one or more of the topics listed above.
          </p>
          <h5>Evaluation</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three three members of the ROSE Festival program
            committee. Contributions must, in a highly convincing manner, clearly articulate their vision, novelty, and
            potential impact. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of soundness, importance of contribution,
            originality, quality of presentation, and potential to inspire discussion. Submissions that are not in
            compliance with the required submission format, or that are out of the scope of the conference, will be
            desk-rejected without being reviewed. Submitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and
            procedures. Papers submitted must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or
            submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration. Submitting the same paper to different tracks of
            ICSME/VISSOFT/SCAM 2021 is also not allowed.
          </p>
          <h5>Publication and Presentation</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE
            Xplore Digital Library. All authors of all accepted papers will be asked to complete an electronic IEEE
            Copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera-ready versions. At least one
            author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference.
            Failure of at least one author to register by the early registration date will result in the paper being
            withdrawn from the conference proceedings. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution
            after the conference (e.g., by not placing it in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library) if the paper is not
            presented at the conference. Presentation details will follow notifications of acceptance.
          </p>
          <h5>How to submit</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">We follow a double-blind reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to the
            following rules:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Author names and affiliations must be omitted. (The track co-chairs will check compliance before
              reviewing begins.)</li>
            <li>References to authors' own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not "We build on our
              previous work..." but rather "We build on the work of [name]...")</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">Please see the Double-Blind Reviewing FAQ for more information and guidance.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format.
            Please use the templates available here. LaTeX users should use the following configuration:
            \documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}. Microsoft Word users should use the US Letter format template. Papers
            must not exceed 4 pages (including figures and appendices) plus up to 1 page that contains ONLY references.
            All submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted online by the deadline via the <a
              href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsme2021" target="_blank">ICSME 2021 EasyChair
              conference management system</a> (“ROSE Festival Position Papers” Track). Any relevant supplemental
            material should also be anonymized and submitted by the same deadline through EasyChair. All authors,
            reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE Code of Conduct.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">ICSME supports and encourages Green Open Access (also called self-archiving). We
            encourage authors to self-archive a preprint of your accepted manuscript in an e-print server such as
            arXiv.org. Open access increases the availability of your work and increases citation impact. To learn more
            about open access, please read the Green Open Access FAQ by Arie van Deursen. Note that if your research
            includes scraped GitHub data, the GitHub Terms of Service require that “publications resulting from that
            research are open access”. If possible, we recommend that you archive your paper (e.g., on arXiv or on your
            website) <b>only after the ICSME reviewing process is completed</b>, to avoid undermining the double-blind
            reviewing process in place.</p>
          <h3>Call for Artifact Submissions</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">We invite authors of papers of all lengths accepted to the ICSME, SCAM, and VISSOFT
            2021 Technical Tracks to submit artifacts associated with those papers to the ICSME Artifact Evaluation
            Papers with artifacts that meet our review criteria will be awarded badges, noting their contributions to
            open science in SE. If an artifact is accepted, authors will be invited to give a lightning talk on the
            artifact during the ROSE festival at ICSME 2021, and we will work with IEEE to add badges corresponding to
            the Available, Reusable, Reproduced, and Replicated categories defined in the table below to the electronic
            versions of the paper(s). Artifacts of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Software, which are implementations of systems or algorithms potentially useful in other studies.</li>
            <li>Automated experiments that replicate the study in the accepted paper.</li>
            <li>Data repositories, which are data (e.g., logging data, system traces, survey raw data) that can be used
              for multiple software engineering approaches.</li>
            <li>Frameworks, which are tools and services illustrating new approaches to software engineering that could
              be used by other researchers in different contexts.</li>
            <li>Qualitative artifacts such as interview scripts and survey templates.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">This list is not exhaustive, so the authors are asked to email the chairs before
            submitting if their proposed artifact is not on this list. For additional types of artifacts please see
            <a href="https://github.com/researchart/all/blob/master/ListOfArtifacts.md" target="_blank">here</a>.

          <p class="text-justify">The goal of this track is to encourage reusable research products. Hence, no

          <h5>Best Artifact Award</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">There will be a Best Artifact Award for each venue (ICSME, VISSOFT, SCAM) to
            recognize
            the effort of authors creating and sharing outstanding research artifacts.</p>
          <h5>Submission and Review</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">Note that all submissions, reviewing, and notifications for this track will be via
            the <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=icsme2021" target="_blank">ICSME 2021 EasyChair
              conference management system</a> (“Artifact Evaluation” Track).</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There will be no emails notifying authors, acknowledging a submission, or informing authors of the
              results
              of the review process.</li>
            <li>During the first week after the submissions, kick-the-tires period, the authors might be asked to
              provide
              clarifications if the reviewers have problems with the artifacts.</li>
            <li>After the kick-the-tires period, the reviewing process can start.</li>
            <li>Authors will be notified of final decisions on the notification date.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">Authors of the papers accepted to the tracks must perform the following steps to
            submit an artifact for the Available (ORO) and Reusable (ROR) badges:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Prepare the artifact</li>
            <li>Make the artifact available</li>
            <li>Document the artifact</li>
            <li>Declare conflict of interest</li>
            <li>Submit the artifact</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text-justify">See <a href="#DocumentingTheArtifact">Document the Artifact</a> below for more details
            on how to submit for Reproduced
            (ROR-R) and Replicated (RER).</p>
          <h5>Preparing the Artifact</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">There are two options depending on the nature of the artifacts: Installation Package
            or Simple Package. In both cases, the configuration and installation for the artifact should take less
            than
            30 minutes. Otherwise the artifact is unlikely to be endorsed simply because the committee will not have
            sufficient time to evaluate it.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>_Installation Package_s: If the artifact consists of a tool or software system, then the authors need
              to
              prepare an installation package so that the tool can be installed and run in the evaluator’s
              environment.
              Provide enough associated instruction, code, and data such that some CS person with a reasonable
              knowledge
              of scripting, build tools, etc. could install, build, and run the code. If the artifact contains or
              requires the use of a special tool or any other non-trivial piece of software the authors must provide a
              VirtualBox VM image or a Docker container image with a working environment containing the artifact and
              all
              the necessary tools. Similarly, if the artifact requires specific hardware, it should be clearly
              documented in the requirements (see Section 3 - DOCUMENTING THE ARTIFACT). Note that we expect that the
              artifacts will have been vetted on a clean machine before submission.</li>
            <li>Simple Package: If the artifact contains only documents that can be used with a simple text editor, a
              PDF
              viewer, or some other common tool (e.g., a spreadsheet program in its basic configuration) the authors
              can
              just save all documents in a single package file (zip or tar.gz).</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Making the Artifact Available</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">Authors need to make the packaged artifact (installation package or simple package)
            available so that the Evaluation Committee can access it. We suggest a link to a public repository or to a
            single archive file in a widely available archive format. If the authors are aiming for the
            <b>available</b>
            badge,
            the artifact needs to be publicly accessible. Note that links to individual websites or links to temporary
            drives (e.g. Google) are non-persistent and thus artifacts placed in such locations will not be considered
            for the <b>available</b> badge. Examples of persistent storages that offer DOI are <a
              href="http://zenodo.org/" target="_blank">Zenodo</a>, <a href="http://figshare.com/"
              target="_blank">figshare</a>, and <a href="http://osf.io/" target="_blank">Open
              Science Framework</a>. Other suitable providers can be found <a
              href="https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories#general" target="_blank">here</a>. For larger
            files like VirtualBox images, we
            recommend the use of such open repositories. Institutional repositories are acceptable. In all cases,
            repositories used to archive data should have a declared plan to enable permanent accessibility.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify">In other cases, the artifacts do not necessarily have to be publicly accessible for
            the review process. In this case, the authors are asked to provide a private link or a password-protected
            link.</p>
          <h5 style="padding-top: 70px; margin-top: -70px;" id="DocumentingTheArtifact">Documenting the Artifact</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">Authors need to write and submit documentation explaining how to obtain the artifact
            package, how to unpack the artifact, how to get started, and how to use the artifacts in sufficient
            detail.
            The artifact submission must describe only the technicalities of the artifacts and uses of the artifact
            that
            are not already described in the paper. The submission should contain the following documents (in markdown
            plain text format within the submission root folder):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A README.md main file describing what the artifact does and how and where it can be obtained (with
              hidden links and access password if necessary). Also, there should be a clear description, step-by-step,
              of how to reproduce the results presented in the paper.
            </li>
            <li>A LICENSE.md file describing the distribution rights. Note that to score "available", then that
              license
              needs to be some form of open source license.</li>
            <li>A REQUIREMENTS.md file describing all necessary software/hardware prerequisites.</li>
            <li>An INSTALL.md file with installation instructions. These instructions should include notes
              illustrating
              a very basic usage example or a method to test the installation. This could be, for instance,
              information
              on what output to expect that confirms that the code is installed and working; and that the code is
              doing
              something interesting and useful.</li>
            <li>A copy of the accepted paper in pdf format.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">For Reproduced (ROR-R) submissions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The original authors must have made artifacts available for use in the reproduction. The artifact must

            <li>Submissions for the Reproduced (ROR-R) badge <b>must fall within the scope of topics covered by ICSME,
                SCAM, and VISSOFT.</b></li>

          </ul>

          <h5>Reviewing the Artifact</h5>
          <p class="text-justify">The review process will be interactive as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Kick-the-tires:</b> Before the actual evaluation, reviewers will check the integrity of the
              artifact
              and
              look for any possible setup problems that may prevent it from being properly evaluated (e.g., corrupted
              or
              missing files, VM won’t start, immediate crashes on the simplest example, etc.). The Evaluation
              Committee
              may contact the authors to request clarifications on the basic installation and start-up procedures or
              to
              resolve simple installation problems. Authors are required to provide responses promptly (within 48h) to
              help reviewers resolve any technical issues with their artifact submission. This phase will be 1 week
              long
              (this is a hard limit) and the authors will be given 2 chances to clarify/fix the problems within this
              period. If the problems remain after the interactions, the submission will be rejected. The number of
              interactions is limited to maintain the workload for the reviewers at a reasonable level.</li>
            <li><b>Artifact assessment</b> Reviewers evaluate the artifacts and provide comments via EasyChair.</li>
            <li><b>Notification</b> Authors are informed of the outcome.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify"><b>Additional information for AUTHORS:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure that a link to the artifact is in the paper submission and it remains there for the CR
              version. The process for awarding badges is conducted after the CR deadline.</li>
            <li>Download the artifact that you have submitted on a clean install and forward your own instructions to
              limit the potential problems that the reviewers might encounter. Include at the end of the INSTALL.md
              the
              configuration for which the installation was tested.</li>
            <li>For software artifacts, consider preparing a virtual image <u>in addition to your self-contained
                artifact</u>:
              this greatly reduces possible problems on the reviewers’ side, and will benefit future users of the
              artifact. Some options include: <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>, <a
                href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>, <a
                href="https://www.vagrantup.com/" target="_blank">Vagrant</a>, <a href="https://www.packer.io/"
                target="_blank">Packer</a>. Non-software artifacts (e.g.
              datasets) should be distributed as a single archive (no need for a VM).</li>
            <li>There will be a maximum of 2 interactions with the reviewer during the <b>kick-the-tires</b> phase.
              Please make
              sure that your answers are clear and provide as much detail as possible to resolve the problems that the
              reviewers are having.</li>
            <li>Reviewers should not need to figure out on their own what the input is for a specific step or what
              output is produced (and where). <b>All</b> usage instructions should be explicitly documented in the
              step-by-step
              instructions of the README.md file.</li>
            <li>Provide an explicit mapping between the results and claims reported in the paper and the steps listed
              in
              the README.md for an easy traceability.</li>
            <li>Place any additional information that does not fit the required type of information in a separate
              document (ADDITIONAL_INFORMATION.md) that you think might be useful.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="text-justify"><b>Additional information for REVIEWERS:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>We adopt the following definitions:
            <li>Documented: At minimum, an inventory of artifacts is included, and sufficient description provided to
              enable the artifacts to be exercised.</li>
            <li>Consistent: The artifacts are relevant to the associated paper, and contribute in some inherent way to
              the generation of its main results.</li>
            <li>Complete: To the extent possible, all components relevant to the paper in question are included.
              (Proprietary artifacts need not be included. If they are required to exercise the package then this
              should
              be documented, along with instructions on how to obtain them. Proxies for proprietary data should be
              included so as to demonstrate the analysis.)</li>
            <li>Exercisable: Included scripts and/or software used to generate the results in the associated paper can
              be successfully executed, and included data can be accessed and appropriately manipulated.</li>
            </li>
            <li>Your goal is to gain sufficient confidence that the results of the paper can be obtained by relying on
              the submitted artifact. You are free to employ any strategy that allows you to do so such as inspecting
              the code, rebuilding it from scratch, changing the code/data, etc. However, none of those are mandatory.
            <li>We do not expect an exhaustive inspection of the original paper results. However, we do recommend a
              partial inspection or, at minimum, a spot-check of the produced data sufficient to gain confidence in
              use
              of the artifact to produce the published research results.</li>
            </li>
            <li>Some artifacts are difficult to run and might require additional hardware/software resources. Those
              will
              be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as typical strategies for evaluation might not be applicable.</li>
            <li>For available badges, artifacts do not need to have been formally evaluated in order for an article to
              receive this badge. In addition, they need not be complete in the sense described above. They simply
              need
              to be relevant to the study and add value beyond the text in the article. Such artifacts could be
              something as simple as the data from which the figures are drawn, or as complex as a complete software
              system under study.</li>
            <li>For reusable badges, the artifacts associated with the paper are of a quality that significantly
              exceeds
              minimal functionality. That is, they have all the qualities of the Functional level, but, in addition,
              they are very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is
              facilitated. In particular, norms and standards of the research community for artifacts of this type are
              strictly adhered to.</li>
            <li>For replicated badges, there must be enough evidence that the results of the paper have been produced
              independently, i.e., without the use of author-supplied artifacts.</li>
            <li>For reproducible badges, it must be clear what was supplied by the authors of the original work and
              there must be a link to that material.</li>
            <li>For replicated and reproducible badges, exact replication or reproduction of results is not required,
              or
              even expected. Instead, the results must be in agreement to within a tolerance deemed acceptable for
              experiments of the given type. In particular, differences in the results should not change the main
              claims
              made in the paper.</li>
