          <hr class="featurette-divider">
          <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">The industry track brings together participants from academia and industry in a venue
            that
            highlights practical and real-world studies of software maintenance and evolution. This track
            aims to foster mutually-beneficial links between those engaged in scientific research and
            practitioners working to improve software maintenance and evolution practices. Experiences
            from practitioners provide crucial input into future research directions and allow others to learn
            from successes and failures.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">The ICSME 2021 industry track highlights practical and real-world studies of software
            maintenance and evolution. Submissions to this track should address:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Real-world success and/or failure stories and evidences evolving and maintaining
              systems</li>
            <li>Experiences and lessons applying state-of-the-art methods, techniques and tools to
              industrial software evolution and maintenance problems</li>
            <li>New and unsolved challenges derived from practical problems</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">We are interested in results, obstacles, and lessons learned. If you apply in an
            industrial
            context a method, technique, or tool that was previously presented at ICSME or another
            software engineering conference, we greatly encourage you to submit to this track. In addition,
            machine learning models now become essential to an intelligent software system. Papers
            reporting experiences and tools on the maintenance and evolution of machine learning models
            in a software system are also welcomed.</p>

          <h3>Submission Types</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">We invite submissions of state-of-the-art practice and experience reports, survey
            reports
            from real-world projects and industrial experiences, and evidence-based identification of
            unsolved research challenges associated with software maintenance and evolution. Each
            submission should describe the problem addressed, the approach used, the current state of the
            project, an evaluation of the benefits or lessons learned, and future developments. Submissions
            may be extended abstracts (1 page), short papers (4 pages) or long papers (10 pages).</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Extended abstracts (1 page)</b> may address:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Important industry needs that are not adequately addressed in the research
                community</li>
              <li>Ways to improve communication between the research and practitioner
                communities
              <li>Ways to make research papers more accessible to industry</li>
              <li>New and unsolved research challenges derived from practical problems</li>
              <li>Success stories reporting benefits and lessons learned</li>
              <li>Failure stories reporting obstacles and lessons learned</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Short papers (4 pages)</b> may address:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>New and unsolved research challenges derived from practical problems</li>
              <li>Success stories reporting benefits and lessons learned</li>
              <li>Failure stories reporting obstacles and lessons learned</li>
              <li>State-of-the-practice and experience reports with empirical evidence</li>
              <li>State-of-the-practice surveys reports from real-world projects</li>
              <li>Application reports about methods, techniques, and tools</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Long papers (10 pages)</b> may include:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>State-of-the-practice and experience reports with empirical evidences</li>
              <li>State-of-the-practice surveys reports from real-world projects</li>
              <li>In-depth application reports about methods, techniques, and tools</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">We welcome submissions that are mainly driven by practitioners as much as
            submissions
            that are mainly driven by researchers!</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Researcher-driven submissions</b>: <p class="text-justify">A paper is considered researcher-driven if
                the main
                author(s) are researchers (the paper can have industrial co-authors). Researcher-driven
                submissions to the industry track should be distinguished from research track
                submissions by richness in industrial data or their focus on industrial cases.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Practitioner-driven submissions</b>: <p class="text-justify">A paper is considered
                practitioner-driven if the main
                author(s) are practitioners (the paper can have co-authors from academia). These
                papers may focus more on specific cases or applications and do not require the same
                degree of generalizability as researcher-driven submissions.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Reviews</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">
            Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the industry track program
            committee. The committee consists of 50-70% of practitioners or industrial researchers, who
            have a good understanding of the value of industry contributions. The evaluation serves the
            purpose to ensure the quality of the submissions and provide constructive feedback. Papers
            that successfully pass the review process will be accepted for presentation and publication. The
            type of the paper (researcher-driven or practitioner-driven) will be considered during the review.
            The below criteria will be considered by the reviewers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Relevance to ICSME audience</b>
              <p class="text-justify">The core concepts of the work either originate in research, either at ICSME or a
                related
                conference, or are novel ICSME-appropriate topics.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Improvement on the state-of-the-practice or state-of-knowledge</b>
              <p class="text-justify">The amount of improvement that the work achieves above and beyond the
                state-of-the-practice (demonstrated with evidence from practice) or the scale of the impact (e.g.,
                individual vs team vs several teams) of the tech transfer work demonstrated with
                evidence from practice. Extended Abstract papers should indeed cover a practical
                problem that practitioners are facing and that our research community might either not
                be aware of, or where our research hasn&#39;t trickled down into a usable (or known) tool so
                that practitioners can use it.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Generality of results (researcher-driven papers)</b>
              <p class="text-justify">The probability that the work, approach, or lessons learned are applicable to
                developers
                outside of the studied group.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Clarity of lessons learned</b>
              <p class="text-justify">The clarity in which the lessons learned are presented and how well they are
                supported with data and discussion.</p>
            </li>
            <li><b>Overall quality of the manuscript</b></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-justify">Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that
            are out of
            the scope of the conference will be rejected without being reviewed. Submitted papers must
            comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures. Papers submitted to the industry track must
            not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review
            elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME 2021.</p>
          </p>
          <h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>
          <p class="text-justify">Accepted papers will be published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Please review
            the
            ICSME 2021 Publication Requirements for more details. Presentation details will follow
            notifications of acceptance.</p>

          <h3>How to Submit</h3>
